# Time Tracking Application

Node provides the RESTful API. Angular provides the frontend and accesses the API. MongoDB stores the data.

I used http://scotch.io/ Node Todo applications as a reference

What application covers so far : 

* Create and delete tasks
* Recording an activity into DB

What is coming next : 
 * Social Media Login
 * Data visualisation for displaying reports

Version 1.0 release : Basic prototype

Note : Missing a lot of features. Will be implemented soon!
